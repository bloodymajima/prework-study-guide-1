# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

My motivation was learning computer languages in order to make a study guide website in which other beginner developers, inclduing myself, could reference. 
This study guide will help beginner developers with keyphrases in basic coding languages. You will always be able to access it, and it is all in one place. 
I learned how to add HTML, CSS and JavaScript through VS Code, along with the basic actions to use Git. This was a good introduction to Github as I was viewing pull requests and issues through my repository on their website.

## Usage

Each section contains notes about different basic coding languages, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you're just starting to learn or need a refresher on vocabulary, it is a good resource to have or come back to. Also, if you open up the DevTools console, you are able to view JavaScript actively run. The functions of JavaScript in this website is listing the topics we learned from the prework and choosing one randomly selected topic to study first.
